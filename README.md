# palindrome.py
Use deque data structure to figure out if a word is a palindrome.

First, each letter of the word will be added to the deque.
Then, the code will remove the fist and last letter of the word until it gets to the center.
Last, the code will compare the fisrt and last letter of the word to check if they are equal or not.
